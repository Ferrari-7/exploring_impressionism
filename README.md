# Exploring impressionist art with VGG16

*Is it possible to produce a classifier which picks up on the sometimes subtle differences in style between artists of the same genre?
Is there any pattern in similarity between artist?*

In this assignment, I'm going to use a pretrained classifier on a dataset containing nearly 5000 pieces of art from ten different impressionist artist. The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/delayedkarma/impressionist-classifier-data)
